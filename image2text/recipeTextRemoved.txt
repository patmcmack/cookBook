The Mash:

Golden Potatoes (about 1.5 Ibs)

Heavy Cream (1/4 cup)

Butter (3 1/2 Tbsp)

Salt

Pepper

Egg Yolks (2)

Parmesan Cheese (1/4 cup, minimum)

Pee ee

PREPARATION
Prep Work:

* Dice the garlic
* Separate your herbs from the stems

* Separate your Egg Yolks

* Peel and Slice your potatoes into even pieces
* Open your wine if it’s not already

* Open your can of Tomato Paste

Cooking the Potatoes:

This part is easy as pie (no pun intended), just boil some water,
throw some salt and your potatoes in, and set a timer for 15
minutes - start on your filling. Upon the timer going off, take
your potatoes out and strain the water off. Put potatoes back into
the pan, or into a medium mixing bowl. Mash the potatoes with
their ingredients from above and keep warm (your filling should
be about done by this point)

 

Cooking the Filling:

Pour Olive Oil into a hot, rather large pan, then add meat. Stir
meat as if your life depends on it for a few minutes so it's nice
and brown, and broken into very small pieces. Add your
Rosemary, Thyme, and Garlic, then stir some more. Quickly add
your Carrot, Onion, and frozen peas, stir a little longer. The idea
at this points to get everything to a minced consistency.

 

  

Add Worcestershire Sauce, stir, add Tomato Puree, stir, add Red
Wine and sweat down for a minute or two. Add chicken stock
and cook for 3 more minutes.

Final Instructions:

Scoop your meat mixture into a deep casserole or other oven safe
dish and then spoon the mash over the top. Spread the mash
over the top of the mix with the bottom of the spoon and then
sprinkle a generous portion of Parmesan cheese over the top.
Poke the top with a fork several times to give it a peaked look and
stick it in the oven at 400 degrees for 18-20 minutes to brown the
potatoes and set the pie. Serve it up and watch people melt!

Fake beef bourguignon (Adam Raguesa)

---Ingredients (serves 8)------

5 pounds thick-cut beef chuck roast (or 4 pounds boneless short ribs)

1 pound carrots

2-3 celery stalks

1 14 oz (400g) bag of frozen peeled pearl onions

5-6 garlic cloves (plus thyme or others}|

1/2 02 (14g, two standard packets) unflavored gelatin

red wine (I used about half a bottle)

stock or water (about as much as the wine)

Worcestershire or soy sauce or fish sauce or some such (and/or a couple stock cubes)
tomato paste (buy the stuff in a tube, if you can)

balsamic vinegar

flour (I used about half a cup, 602)

fresh herbs for garnish (I used the leaves from the celery)

salt/pepper/oil

--Steps-~
Take a deep roasting pan (at least 9x13 in / 23-33 cm), put it in the oven, and turn on the broiler/grill. While the pan heats up, trim as much of the large, white
bands of inter-muscular fat out of the chuck as possible. (No need to trim anything if using boneless short ribs.) Cut the meat into very large chunks, keeping in
mind they'll shrink more than half while cooking. Season the meat generously with salt & pepper, and toss it in a thin coating of oil.

 

 

 

Take the hot roasting pan out of the oven and dump in the meat, trying to spread it all into a single layer across the bottom. Put the pan back under the broiler
and let the meat brown for about 10 minutes — watch it carefully to make sure nothing burns. Pull the pan out and stir in enough flour to generously coat the
meat (I used about half a cup / 60g). Put the pan back under the broiler and let the flour brown for a few minutes. Lay a squeeze or two or tomato paste on top
and let that brown for a minute.

Turn off the broiler, take the pan back out, pour in enough wine to come 1/3 of the way up the meat. Pour in enough stock or water so that the liquid comes 2/3
of the way up the meat. Throw in a big glug of Worcestershire or soy sauce or some such, and maybe a couple stock cubes if you used plain water (really not
necessary, though). Stir everything up, cover the pan tightly with foil and cook in the oven at 275°F/1352C until the meat is almost as soft as you want it, which
took me four hours.

   

 

   

For the roasted garlic mash, trim the tips off of all the cloves on a head of garlic, coat it in oil, wrap it in foil and put it in the oven with the meat. At such a low
temperature, it should take hours to go soft and golden, so put it in soon after you get the meat going.

 

While you're waiting you can peel the carrots (or not) and cut them and the celery into large bite-size chunks, and crush and peel 5-6 garlic cloves.

When the beef
them stirre:
with fe

almost as fork-tender as you want it, put the carrots, celery and frozen onions in the pan. Get them spread into an even layer and try to get
with the beef and sauce, but don't stir so hard that you break the beef apart. It's fine if the veg is kinda sitting on top for now. Re-cover the pan
put it back in the oven and cook until the vegetables are as tender as you want them, 1-2 hours.

 

 

 

Empty the gelatin packets into a little cup or bowl and stir in just enough cold water to get it dissolved — it'll thicken up (bloom) rapidly.

Take the roasting pan out of the oven when the vegetables are as soft as you want them. Taste the sauce and add more salt and pepper if needed (it should taste
a little too salty on its own). I like to add a glug of balsamic vinegar at this point. Drop the bloomed gelatin into the pan in dollops. Use a spatula to gently fold all
the ingredients together without breaking up the soft beef chunks. It's ok if the sauce isn’t totally homogenous yet.

Put the pan back in the oven uncovered, turn on the broiler and brown the top, which took me 10 minutes. Serve the stew over mash potatos or egg noodles,
garnish with herbs.

Ragu Bolognese (JKLA)

 

|
A glug of extra-virgin olive oil
4-6 ounces (120-160g) finely diced pancetta or salt pork
1/2 pound (225g) each of ground beef, lamb, and pork
(you can use all beef instead of beef and lamb, or a mix of beef, veal, and pork)
Salt and pepper
1 large onion, minced
2 large ribs of celery, minced
1 large carrot, minced
4-5 cloves of fresh garlic, smashed and minced
Handful of minced fresh parsley and sage (optional, you can also use a bundle of rosemary or thyme)
1/4 cup (50g) tomato paste
1 cup dry wine (white or red is fine)
2 cups chicken stock (if using store-bought stock, sprinkle it with a
couple tablespoons of gelatin and set it aside until the gelatin is hydrated before using it)
1 cup milk

To finish:
Fresh minced parsley and/or basil, freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and some more extra-virgin
olive oil

1. Heat the oil in a wide straight-sided sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until
shimmering. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring occasoinally, until it's well-browned and the fat has
mostly rendered off, a few minutes. Add the meat, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook,
breaking it up with a spoon, until it's pretty well-browned as well, 7 minutes or so.

2. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are softened but
not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the minced parsley and/or sage (or the bundle of rosemary or
thyme) and the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant. There should be a large amount of
browned solids on the bottom of the pan by now.

3. Add the wine and cook, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking
until sauce is thick and the wine has fully reduced. Add the stock and milk and stir to combine.

4, Bring to a boil, then reduce heat until the sauce is at the barest simmer. Cook, stirring now and
then, until the sauce is rich and thick and emulsified. Fat may break out as it cooks and forma
reddish slick on top. This is OK, just keep cooking and that fat will eventually get re-emulsified into
the sauce.

5. To serve, cook up some good fresh pasta (tagliatelle is traditional) or a hearty bronze-cut dry
pasta such as rigatoni just until al dente (typically 10% or so less than package directions) in water
that is about as salty as your tears. Transfer the cooked pasta to a large skillet and spoon some of
the ragu on top of it. Add some minced parsley and/or basil, some freshly grated cheese, a drizzle
of olive oil, and a big splash of the pasta cooking-water. Cook over high heat, tossing constantly,
until the sauce is creamy and coast the pasta (add more pasta water as necessary if it looks dry or
if the fat breaks out). Serve right away.

Put a little oil in a large lidded pot on moderate heat and slowly brown the short ribs on all
sides. Do not let anything burn. If you're doubling this recipe, brown the ribs in two
batches. Take them them out, and throw in the roughly chopped onion, carrots and celery.
Let the veggies brown for a minute, then stir in the tomato paste. Right before the tomato
paste burns (itll happen in a minute), deglaze with the wine. Put in the anise, coriander,

Since a lot of people are asking, here's how |
made this:

Started my rice; one cup rice, two cups water.

While the rice was cooking | took my pound of
pork chops, seasoned with dried minced garlic,
salt, pepper, and onion powder, and cooked them
on medium heat in oil in a frying pan. Once they
were fully cooked, | chopped them into bite size
pieces. Then set it aside.

Took three eggs, cracked and stirred in a bowl.
Then cooked them in the frying pan like a
pancake. Chopped the egg and set it aside.

Then took my 16 ounces of frozen vegetables and
heated them up in the pan. Once fully heated, |
threw back in the egg, pork, and my now cooked
rice. Added soy sauce to taste.
