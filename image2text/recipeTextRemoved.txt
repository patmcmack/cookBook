Fake beef bourguignon (Adam Raguesa)

---Ingredients (serves 8)------

5 pounds thick-cut beef chuck roast (or 4 pounds boneless short ribs)

1 pound carrots

2-3 celery stalks

1 14 oz (400g) bag of frozen peeled pearl onions

5-6 garlic cloves (plus thyme or others}|

1/2 02 (14g, two standard packets) unflavored gelatin

red wine (I used about half a bottle)

stock or water (about as much as the wine)

Worcestershire or soy sauce or fish sauce or some such (and/or a couple stock cubes)
tomato paste (buy the stuff in a tube, if you can)

balsamic vinegar

flour (I used about half a cup, 602)

fresh herbs for garnish (I used the leaves from the celery)

salt/pepper/oil

--Steps-~
Take a deep roasting pan (at least 9x13 in / 23-33 cm), put it in the oven, and turn on the broiler/grill. While the pan heats up, trim as much of the large, white
bands of inter-muscular fat out of the chuck as possible. (No need to trim anything if using boneless short ribs.) Cut the meat into very large chunks, keeping in
mind they'll shrink more than half while cooking. Season the meat generously with salt & pepper, and toss it in a thin coating of oil.

 

 

 

Take the hot roasting pan out of the oven and dump in the meat, trying to spread it all into a single layer across the bottom. Put the pan back under the broiler
and let the meat brown for about 10 minutes — watch it carefully to make sure nothing burns. Pull the pan out and stir in enough flour to generously coat the
meat (I used about half a cup / 60g). Put the pan back under the broiler and let the flour brown for a few minutes. Lay a squeeze or two or tomato paste on top
and let that brown for a minute.

Turn off the broiler, take the pan back out, pour in enough wine to come 1/3 of the way up the meat. Pour in enough stock or water so that the liquid comes 2/3
of the way up the meat. Throw in a big glug of Worcestershire or soy sauce or some such, and maybe a couple stock cubes if you used plain water (really not
necessary, though). Stir everything up, cover the pan tightly with foil and cook in the oven at 275°F/1352C until the meat is almost as soft as you want it, which
took me four hours.

   

 

   

For the roasted garlic mash, trim the tips off of all the cloves on a head of garlic, coat it in oil, wrap it in foil and put it in the oven with the meat. At such a low
temperature, it should take hours to go soft and golden, so put it in soon after you get the meat going.

 

While you're waiting you can peel the carrots (or not) and cut them and the celery into large bite-size chunks, and crush and peel 5-6 garlic cloves.

When the beef
them stirre:
with fe

almost as fork-tender as you want it, put the carrots, celery and frozen onions in the pan. Get them spread into an even layer and try to get
with the beef and sauce, but don't stir so hard that you break the beef apart. It's fine if the veg is kinda sitting on top for now. Re-cover the pan
put it back in the oven and cook until the vegetables are as tender as you want them, 1-2 hours.

 

 

 

Empty the gelatin packets into a little cup or bowl and stir in just enough cold water to get it dissolved — it'll thicken up (bloom) rapidly.

Take the roasting pan out of the oven when the vegetables are as soft as you want them. Taste the sauce and add more salt and pepper if needed (it should taste
a little too salty on its own). I like to add a glug of balsamic vinegar at this point. Drop the bloomed gelatin into the pan in dollops. Use a spatula to gently fold all
the ingredients together without breaking up the soft beef chunks. It's ok if the sauce isn’t totally homogenous yet.

Put the pan back in the oven uncovered, turn on the broiler and brown the top, which took me 10 minutes. Serve the stew over mash potatos or egg noodles,
garnish with herbs.

Since a lot of people are asking, here's how |
made this:

Started my rice; one cup rice, two cups water.

While the rice was cooking | took my pound of
pork chops, seasoned with dried minced garlic,
salt, pepper, and onion powder, and cooked them
on medium heat in oil in a frying pan. Once they
were fully cooked, | chopped them into bite size
pieces. Then set it aside.

Took three eggs, cracked and stirred in a bowl.
Then cooked them in the frying pan like a
pancake. Chopped the egg and set it aside.

Then took my 16 ounces of frozen vegetables and
heated them up in the pan. Once fully heated, |
threw back in the egg, pork, and my now cooked
rice. Added soy sauce to taste.

+ 1/2 cup vegetable oil

+ 1/2 cup all purpose flour

+ Zbay leaves

+ B ounces beer (just not a light beer!)

+ 4cups chicken stock

+ 1b andouille sausage, cut into coins (or smoked kielbasa)
+ 1b boneless, skinless, chicken thighs

+ Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

+ [tbsp cayenne pepper

Chicken & Sausage Gumbo
1. Take 1 small green bell pepper, 2 ribs of celery, and 1 small white onion (also known as the “holy trinity”)
and dice them into medium-sized pieces. Set aside for later.
2, Mince 6 garlic cloves and set aside for later.

3. For the roux, add % cup of vegetable oil to a pot and allow it to get smoking hot before adding % cup of all
purpose flour. Using a wooden spoon or preferably a whisk, mix together until the consistency is similar

to wet sand.

4. Within 30 seconds, the roux should be the color of milk chocolate. The darker the roux gets, the more you

 

need to stir it, but let it sit for a few seconds before continuing to s!

 

After about 5-6 minutes, the color
of the roux should be nice and dark or similar to the color of a Hershey's chocolate bar. Set aside some of

the roux to use later.

5, Add 2 bay leaves as well as your “holy trinity” to the pot. Make sure to set aside some of the holy tri

 

mix for later.
6. Once the mixture calms down a bit, add the minced garlic to the pot. Let the roux sit for 30 seconds.

7. Add 8 ounces of beer and stir it in and whisk to prevent the mixture from becoming clumpy. Then, add 4

 

cups of chicken stock and whisk using the same procedure as the beer.
8, Take 1 lb of andouille sausage or smoked kielbasa and cut into coins.

9. Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to both sides of 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

Sear the chicken thighs in a smoking hot pan with oil.
10. Add 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt to the roux.

11, Turn the stovetop temperature to the lowest simmer possible and add a generous amount of black pepper

to the roux. Then, add 1 tbsp of smoked paprika and stir.

 

12. After browning the chicken, add it straight to the pot and set aside the remaining oil from the chicken.

 

Next, add the chopped up sausage or smoked kielbasa to the pot.
13. Bring the roux to a bare simmer, cover it, and let sit for a couple of hours.

14, Serve with cooked white rice, garnish with scallions, and enjoy!
