            \end{itemize}}
            {\begin{enumerate}

                  \item Roughly chop one of the onions and fry it in the same pot until golden. Put in maybe a teaspoon (or more) each of the ground cumin,               coriander and paprika, grind in some pepper, and fry the spices for a minute. Put the chicken back in, and cover with about half white wine, half water. Salt. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the chicken begins falling about (30 mins).
                  \item For the salsa verde, cut the chiles in half, scrape out and discard the seeds. Husk the tomatillos, rinse, and cut them in half. Roughly cut other onion. Put the veggies and lime into a wide pan and toss them in olive oil. Put the pan into the oven at 450 F. After the salsa has a bit of color, put in the whole peeled garlic cloves and stir. Cook maybe 20 mins total. Broil for a few minutes on high, Squeeze the lime juice and discard. Puree until smooth.
                  \item Grate up the cheese. Put maybe half a cup of the salsa into the chicken, along with half of the cheese. Mix up the filling and check for seasoning.
                  \item Grease a 7x11 inch baking dish. Dunk a tortilla into the salsa, scoop in a modest line of filling, and roll up the tortilla, seam-side down. Repeat until you've filled your baking dish and/or exhausted your filling. Spoon the extra salsa and cheese on top of the enchiladas. Bake uncovered until the cheese is browned, maybe 20 mins. Garnish with cilantro.
