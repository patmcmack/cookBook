                  \item Roughly chop one of the onions and fry it in the same pot until golden. Put in maybe a teaspoon (or more) each of the ground cumin,               coriander and paprika, grind in some pepper, and fry the spices for a minute. Put the chicken back in, and cover with about half white wine, half water. Salt. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the chicken begins falling about (30 mins).
                  \item For the salsa verde, cut the chiles in half, scrape out and discard the seeds. Husk the tomatillos, rinse, and cut them in half. Roughly cut other onion. Put the veggies and lime into a wide pan and toss them in olive oil. Put the pan into the oven at 450 F. After the salsa has a bit of color, put in the whole peeled garlic cloves and stir. Cook maybe 20 mins total. Broil for a few minutes on high, Squeeze the lime juice and discard. Puree until smooth.
                  \item Grate up the cheese. Put maybe half a cup of the salsa into the chicken, along with half of the cheese. Mix up the filling and check for seasoning.
                  \item Grease a 7x11 inch baking dish. Dunk a tortilla into the salsa, scoop in a modest line of filling, and roll up the tortilla, seam-side down. Repeat until you've filled your baking dish and/or exhausted your filling. Spoon the extra salsa and cheese on top of the enchiladas. Bake uncovered until the cheese is browned, maybe 20 mins. Garnish with cilantro.

                  \item Meanwhile make the gravy: cook the sausage in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon until itâ€™s not longer pink. If the pan is very dry, add a couple teaspoons of oil or butter to moisten it. Add 1 tablespoon of flour and stir to incorporate. Whisk in the heavy cream or milk. Bring to a simmer while stirring frequently and adjust the consistency with more heavy cream or milk if itâ€™s too thick. Season aggressively with black pepper and salt.
                  \item When the biscuits are done, transfer to a plate and smother with the sausage gravy. Serve.

Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 15--20 minutes.
                  \item Garnish salad with parmesan using a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts.

            {\begin{enumerate}    % Cooking Instructions
                  \item   Heat the oil in a wide straight-sided sautÃ© pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the pancetta and cook, until it's well-browned and the fat has mostly rendered off, a few mins. Add the meat, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's pretty well-browned as well, 7 mins
                  \item Add the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 5 mins. Add the minced parsley and/or sage (or the bundle of rosemary or thyme) and the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant. There should be a large amount of browned solids on the bottom of the pan by now.
                  \item Add the wine and cook, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking until sauce is thick and the wine has fully reduced. Add the stock and milk.
                  \item Bring to a boil, then reduce heat until the sauce is at the barest simmer. Cook about 30 mins, stirring now and then, until the sauce is rich and thick and emulsified. Fat may break out as it cooks and forms a reddish slick on top. This is OK, just keep cooking and that fat will eventually get re-emulsified into the sauce.
                  \item  To serve, cook up some good fresh pasta (tagliatelle or rigatoni) just until al dente. Transfer the cooked pasta to a large skillet and spoon some of the ragu on top of it. Add some minced parsley and/or basil, some freshly grated cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, and a big splash of the pasta cooking-water. Cook over high heat, tossing constantly, until the sauce is creamy and coast the pasta. Serve right away.

                  \item 3 Carrots

                  \item Butter 
            \end{itemize}}
            {\begin{enumerate}    % Cooking Instructions
                  \item  Put a little oil in a large lidded pot on moderate heat and slowly brown the short ribs on all sides in batches. Do not let anything burn. Take them them out, and throw in the roughly chopped onion, carrots and celery. Let the veggies brown for a minute, then stir in the tomato paste. Then deglaze with the wine. Put in the anise, coriander, pepper and a big pinch of salt. Put the ribs back in, reduce the heat to a bare simmer, cover, and let cook for 8 hours.
                  \item Carefully remove meat to a plate, discard bones. Strain the braising liquid and discard the solids. Add some ice cubes and throw the liquid in the fridge to solidify fat out. Cover the meat and throw it in the fridge.
                  \item After you've de-fatted your braising liquid, reserve the fat and throw the liquid into a wide pan. Bring it to a boil and reduce it to a glaze â€” about a half hour. Stir it constantly and maybe reduce the heat toward the end to keep it from sticking and burning. Taste the glaze, and give it some more seasoning and maybe some vinegar to taste (it should taste too strong on its own). Reduce the heat to warm and carefully toss the meat in the glaze then cover and let the meat re-heat. 
                  \item While the sauce is reducing, peel, chunk up and boil your potatoes until easily pierced with a fork. Drain them off, put in a glug of milk, a big pinch of salt, and the reserved fat from the beef. Mash, stir and taste. Add more milk and salt until you like it. Chop up the fresh rosemary and stir it into the mash right before you eat.
                  \item Thaw some frozen peas and add butter and salt to taste. When you get everything on the plate, be sure to spoon some extra glaze over the beef.

                  \item  Peel the carrots and discard the outer peels. Then use your peeler to cut as many thin ribbons as possible out of the carrots, discarding the core. Cut the root ends off the green onions, as well as the dry green tops, and peel off any undesirable outer layers. Bisect each onion and pull the layers apart from each other. Peel and slice/chop the garlic, and thinly slice the chili.
                  \item Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a cast iron or nonstick pan on medium, and coat the bottom with olive oil. When it's shimmering, lay in the thighs, skin-side down. Place the brick (covered in foil) on top of chicken 
                  \item Reduce the heat, possibly to low. Use your nose to perceive whether the skin is burning. After about 10 minutes, remove the brick, and flip the chicken pieces to cook the raw side, about 5 additional minutes to make sure the interior is thoroughly cooked. (If the skins aren't brown enough to your liking, you could always turn up the heat right at the end and brown them some more.) Remove to a plate to rest.
                  \item Dump your vegetables into the pan, turn the heat up to medium-high, and stir constantly to get everything coated in chicken fat and cooked evenly. After about 5 minutes, the vegetables should be almost tender. Taste for seasoning, and stir in any needed salt, plus the juice of half a lemon

            {\begin{enumerate}    % Cooking Instructions
                  \item  Cut the stalks off the fennel and reserve. Finely chop the bulb and get it cooking in a little olive oil in a wide pan on medium-high heat. Add diced onion. After aboutt 5 min, put in the sausage, and stir aggressively with a wooden spoon to break everything up. 
                  \item Keep cooking, stirring, and scraping the pan for about 20 minutes, until everything is very brown and the fond on the bottom of the pan is about to burn. Deglaze with just enough white wine to clean the pan. Turn off the heat, and mix in just enough breadcrumbs to soak up any loose liquid and get you a dry, crumbly texture. Mix in the zest of one lemon, and leave the stuffing to cool.
                  \item Butterfly the pork loin (I don't know how to describe this, just watch the video) then pound it out as flat as possible with a smooth meat mallet. Lay the stuffing onto the cut-side of the pork, as smooth, thin and flat as possible, leaving a small bare strip on the end of the pork that has the fat cap on the opposite side. Roll up the pork so that the fat cap is on the outside, on top. Tie with twine, place into same pan and into oven at 400F. Cover with oil, salt, pepper, add halfed lemons. Roast until internally reads 140F
                  \item Remove the roast and lemons to a cutting board and let it rest. Bring the roasting pan to a boil on high heat and deglaze with about half a bottle of white wine. Boil until it just starts to look syrupy, then turn off the heat. Mix in a knob of cold butter.
                  \item Carve the roast. Drizzle the wine jus over top, garnish with the reserved fennel fronds, and serve with the roasted lemons.
