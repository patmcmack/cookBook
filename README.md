Open [``` cookBook.pdf```](https://github.com/patmcmack/cookBook/blob/Main/cookBook.pdf) to view. 

This is a cookbook I wrote simply to keep track of recipes that I enjoy, taken from multiple sources. Written in *LaTex* with design inspiration from **ORLY** textbooks.

Also an excuse for me to practice using GitHub.

The original cover template was adapted from GitHub user [johnjohnlin](https://github.com/johnjohnlin/oreilly_cover)

Originally I kept track of these recipes in a spreadsheet using screenshots. This was not extensible or easy to manage. 

To save time when covering said screenshots to text, I wrote a short Python script that used ```pytesseract``` to export the images to a simple .txt file. From that, I could simply cut into my .tex file to produce the cookbook
